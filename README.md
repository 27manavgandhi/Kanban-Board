# Kanban Board

Welcome to the Kanban Board project repository! This project is a feature-rich Kanban board application designed to streamline your workflow, visualize tasks, and boost productivity. The project is built using a combination of modern technologies.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** The structure of the application is built using HTML5 for a semantic and well-organized layout.

- **CSS:** CSS is used for styling the application, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.

- **Chakra UI:** We've leveraged Chakra UI, a component library for React, to create a consistent and responsive user interface.

- **JavaScript:** The core functionality and interactivity of the Kanban board are powered by JavaScript.

- **React:** The application is built as a single-page application (SPA) using React, which provides a smooth and efficient user experience.

- **Redux:** Redux is used for state management, allowing us to manage application-wide state and ensure data consistency.

- **Express.js:** We've used Express.js to build the server side of the application, enabling us to handle API requests and perform various server-related tasks.

- **Node.js:** Node.js is the runtime environment that powers our server and allows us to run JavaScript on the server side.

- **MongoDB:** MongoDB is the NoSQL database used to store and manage data for the Kanban board, providing a flexible and scalable data storage solution.
